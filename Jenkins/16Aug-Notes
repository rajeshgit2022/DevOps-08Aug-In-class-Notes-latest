Jenkins integration with Maven

Maven:
*************

Maven is a plugin based tool
Any task you want to do with maven, you will use its plugins 
As a devops engineer you need to know 5-7 plugins only

In maven there are 2 types of plugins:

Core plugins : needed for core build process

Tasks			Name Plugin		Command/GOAL
***********************************************************************
Compile the code	Compiler		mvn compile

test the code		Surefire		mvn test

Package the code	package			mvn package


Review plugins: plugins needed for verification and review process

These plugin will generate static code anaylysis reports with details on 
coverage, complexity, review, bugs, programming errors

Reports are always generated in XML, .csv or html

Tasks			Name Plugin		Command/GOAL
***********************************************************************

Code review		pmd			mvn pmd:pmd

Code Coverage		cobertura		mvn cobertura:cobertura


For every plugin there is a maven command in order to execute the plugin and perform core task on the source code

We will use all the 5 plugins today to create a CI pipeline

Set up on Jenkins to integrate with JAVA GIT & Maven :


Jenkins--> Manage Jenkins-->Global Tool configuration

Go to JDK section
Click on Add JDL
In this give:

2. JDK name as myjava
 Uncheck checkbox -- install automatically

3 go to terminal/server ==> mvn --version

4. copy the value of variable java Home

JAVA_HOME = /usr/lib/jvm/java-1.8.0-openjdk-1.8.0.265.b01-1.amzn2.0.1.x86_64

5. Add in jenkins also under JDK

JAVA_HOME = /usr/lib/jvm/java-1.8.0-openjdk-1.8.0.265.b01-1.amzn2.0.1.x86_64


Under GIT==> leave it same 

Under maven ==> lets install it automatically
Type name as  mymaven and check the install automatically box.
Save the changes


All set to create pipelines

In jenkins there are 2 types of syntax to write pipeline

> scripted pipeline code

Was used to write pipelines with Jenkins version1

it was very difficult jenkins admino write the code, in order the code one has to be very good at DSL scripting

the pipeline always starts with keyword "node"

everything is defined by the author of the script

There is no fixed template or stages or steps that one can follow

> declarative Pipeline syntax

With Jenkisn 2 we now use declarative pipeline code to write CICD pipelines
It is very strcutured, and has differenct sections to perform various task of pipeline
It very easy to write and easy to read
It is declarative in nature 
 key value
eg:  tool jenkins
     jdk myjava

for all who are new to jenkins pipelines, Jenkins provide a code Snippet generator, using which you can generate your pipeline and learn it very easily


Structure of Declarative pipeline:

pipeline{

tools{

// tools to be used by the pipeline

}

agent {
// names of master and slave where the tasks have to be executed
}

parameters{
  // defined variables and give values
}

stages{

	stage('task1')
     	{
		steps{
			// steps to execute commands
			}
 		}
	stage('task2')
     	{
		steps{
			// steps to execute commands
			}
 		}




}



}


pipeline{
    
    tools{
        jdk 'myjava'
        maven 'mymaven'
    }
    
    agent any
    
    stages{
        stage('Clone Repo')
        {
            steps{
                git 'https://github.com/Sonal0409/DevOpsCodeDemo.git'
            }
        }
        
        stage('Compile the code')
        {
            steps{
               
                sh 'mvn compile'
            }
        }
        
        stage('Code Analysis')
        {
            steps{
                sh 'mvn pmd:pmd'
            }
        }
        
        stage('code coverage')
        {
            steps{
                sh 'mvn cobertura:cobertura -Dcobertura.report.format=xml'
            }
        }
        
        stage('Build the artifact')
        {
            steps{
                sh 'mvn package'
            }
        }
    }
}
